TODO:

 - spawn asteroids at edges - done (well, spawned with a min radius from player)
 - asteroids in linked list - working
 - timer-based constant framerate - fps counter set up. Needs more work to alleviate slowdown. Threading?
 - single triangle rendering function
 - generate asteroids as triangle strips
 - proper title screen
 - high score saving to mem card.
 - bullets as linked lists.
