# BLASTEROIDS - a homebrew Asteroids clone for PS1

---

This is a fairly simple version of the venerable Asteroids game that I used to learn the basics of programming the Playstation. It's inspired by the Atari 2600 version. That version is arguably the worst port of Asteroids that exists, but it was my first exposure to Asteroids, so it has a special place in my heart.

## Features: 
- Randomly generated asteroid shapes!
- Scoring!
- A count of remaining asteroids!
- Brakes!
- No Hyperspace!

## Features Missing:
- Sound :(
- UFO :( :(
- High score saving
- probably more?

This version was borne out of the wonderful tutorials by Lameguy64: [http://lameguy64.net/tutorials/pstutorials/](http://lameguy64.net/tutorials/pstutorials/)

The asteroid generation was inspired (or directly lifted...) from Daniel Shiffman's Coding Train series. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTTuih7P0c0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTTuih7P0c0)

The doubly linked-list code comes from the book "Mastering Algorithms with C" by Kyle Loudon, published by O'Reilly & Associates.
